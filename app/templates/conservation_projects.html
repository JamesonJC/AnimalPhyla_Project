            <h2>About Sea Turtles</h2>
            <p>Sea turtles are ancient creatures that have roamed the oceans for millions of years. They belong to the reptile order Testudines and have adapted to life in the water. Sea turtles play a vital role in maintaining marine ecosystems by controlling jellyfish populations and providing habitats for other marine life.</p>
            <p>There are seven species of sea turtles, including the Green sea turtle, Loggerhead sea turtle, Leatherback sea turtle, Hawksbill sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, Olive ridley sea turtle, and Flatback sea turtle. Unfortunately, all of these species are endangered or threatened due to various human activities such as pollution, habitat destruction, and illegal trade.</p>

            <h2>About Tigers</h2>
            <p>Tigers are the largest of all big cats and are renowned for their strength, agility, and majestic appearance. They are apex predators, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.</p>
            <p>There are six subspecies of tigers: Bengal, Indochinese, Malayan, Siberian (also known as Amur), South China, and Sumatran. Unfortunately, all tiger subspecies are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.</p>

        <section id="elephants">
            <h2>About Elephants</h2>
            <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth and are highly intelligent and social animals. They play a crucial role in shaping their habitats and are often referred to as keystone species.</p>
            <p>There are three species of elephants: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. All three species are threatened by habitat loss, poaching for ivory, and human-elephant conflict.</p>

        <section id="polarBears">
            <h2>About Polar Bears</h2>
            <p>Polar bears are iconic symbols of the Arctic and are superbly adapted to life in a harsh environment. They are classified as marine mammals because they spend most of their lives on sea ice.</p>
            <p>Climate change is the biggest threat to polar bears as it leads to the loss of sea ice, which is essential for their hunting and breeding. Pollution, oil and gas exploration, and human disturbance also pose significant threats to their survival.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="rhinoceros">
            <h2>About Rhinoceros</h2>
            <p>Rhinoceroses, often referred to as rhinos, are large herbivores known for their distinctive horns and prehistoric appearance. They play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystems through grazing and seed dispersal.</p>
            <p>There are five species of rhinoceros: the Black rhinoceros, White rhinoceros, Indian rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, and Sumatran rhinoceros. All rhinoceros species are threatened by poaching for their horns, habitat loss, and human encroachment.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="whales">
            <h2>About Whales</h2>
            <p>Whales are magnificent marine mammals that include some of the largest animals on Earth. They play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, influencing the food chain and nutrient cycling.</p>
            <p>There are two main types of whales: baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales, such as the Blue whale and Humpback whale, filter feed on small organisms like krill. Toothed whales, such as the Sperm whale and Orca, hunt for fish and squid using their teeth.</p>
            <p>Whales face numerous threats, including habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and entanglement in fishing gear. Whaling, although significantly reduced, still poses a threat to some whale populations.</p>
